# P5.js Starter Template

This is an "empty" starter template if you want to work with P5js locally on your computer without using [P5Live](https://teddavis.org/p5live). With this approach you can also use your creations and embed for example on a website.

## Setup

To  code editor of your choice (we recommend ) and install a live server plugin. This plugin simulates a web server so you have the same working conditions like having your project on a "real" website. We can recommend you to editors:

1. [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Go to Plugins and search for Live Server by Ritwick Dey -> Install
3. Open current project folder in Visual Studio Code
4. In the bottom right corner click -> Go Live
5. A browser window will open showing the project.

## Folder Structure

We provide you with starting templates to download (on the top of the page). They will have the following folder structure:

```
00_empty_template //folder top open in editor, can be renamed
│   index.html //the file shown by the browser
│   sketch.js //this is where your p5.js code will go!
│
└─── assets //the files required by the website
     │  
     │
     └─── css
     │   └─── style.css  //stylesheet for this website
     │
     └─── p5js //p5js library

```
