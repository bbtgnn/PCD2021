# P5.js Starter Template

This is a starter template if you want to work with [P5js](p5js.org/) locally on your computer without using [P5Live](https://teddavis.org/p5live). You can use the same commands and functions like we used during our workshop. However, with this approach you can also use your code and embed it for example on a website.

## Setup

To write code you need a editor (we recommend Visual Studio Code, but others work too) and install a server plugin. This plugin simulates a web server so you have the same working conditions like having your project on a "real" website.

1. [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. On the left side, go to plugins and search for *Live Server* by Ritwick Dey, hit install!
3. Download the files from this folder and open it in Visual Studio Code
4. In the bottom right corner click *Go Live*
5. A browser window will open and you will see your sketch.

## Working with the template

All the code that you have written during the workshop in [P5Live](https://teddavis.org/p5live) is now inside the file `sketch.js`. Have a look at the folder structure:

```
p5js_local_template // the folder to open in Visual Studio Code, it can be renamed
│   index.html //the file shown by the browser
│   sketch.js //this is where your p5.js code will go!
│
└─── assets //the files required by the website
     │  
     │
     └─── css
     │   └─── style.css  //stylesheet for this website
     │
     └─── p5js //p5js library 

```

Have fun!
